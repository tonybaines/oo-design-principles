Problems with inheritance
* It breaks encapsulation - subclasses have access to protected implementation details and members
* It creates high coupling - by definition, you can't have a subclass without it's parent(s), and changes to the parent necessitate changes to the subclasses
* Comprehension is harder - understanding which implementation a subclass uses
